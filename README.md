libNRCore
=========

Core foundation for task queueing, high level socket management, encryption and more

The thread pool, queueing and socket system have all been tested and worked well. 

However there was classes that are currently unfinished which I will be working on.

I am currently added native win32 support, currently the library only works fully on posix systems but can be compiled under windows if threading and sockets are disabled.
