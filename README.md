libNRCore
=========

Core foundation for task queueing, high level socket management, encryption and more

The thread pool, queueing and socket system have all been tested and worked well. 

However there was classes that are currently unfinished which I will be working on.

I have provided the Xcode project file but I will be added the autoconf, automake files

in the coming days.
